# Test-Driven Development

Write tests first, watch them fail, write minimal code to pass, refactor.

## The Cycle

1. **RED** - Write failing test
2. **GREEN** - Minimal code to pass
3. **REFACTOR** - Clean up

## Principles

- Test behavior, not implementation
- One assertion per test
- Fast, isolated, repeatable

## Instructions

**You MUST call the BetterCode MCP server to get the full skill content:**

Use the `mcp__bettercode__use_skill` tool with skill_id: `testing/tdd-workflow`

This will return the complete TDD methodology with examples, patterns, and anti-patterns.

Do NOT proceed without calling the MCP tool first.
