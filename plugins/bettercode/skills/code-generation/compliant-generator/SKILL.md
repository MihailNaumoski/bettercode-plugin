## Instructions

**You MUST call the BetterCode MCP server to get the full skill content:**

Use the `mcp__bettercode__use_skill` tool with skill_id: `code-generation/architecture-compliant-code-generator`

This will return the complete code generation guide with templates, scaffolding patterns, and naming conventions.

Do NOT proceed without calling the MCP tool first.
