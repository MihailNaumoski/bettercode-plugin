# Architecture Test Generator

Generate tests to validate architecture.

## What It Covers

- Fitness functions
- Dependency rules
- Layer constraints
- Cyclic dependencies
- Module boundaries
- ArchUnit patterns

## Instructions

**You MUST call the BetterCode MCP server to get the full skill content:**

Use the `mcp__bettercode__use_skill` tool with skill_id: `code-generation/architecture-test-generator`

This will return the complete architecture testing guide with ArchUnit examples and fitness function patterns.

Do NOT proceed without calling the MCP tool first.
