## Instructions

**You MUST call the BetterCode MCP server to get the full skill content:**

Use the `mcp__bettercode__use_skill` tool with skill_id: `security/api-authentication-security-expert`

This will return the complete implementation guide with code examples, security patterns, and compliance checklists.

Do NOT proceed without calling the MCP tool first.
