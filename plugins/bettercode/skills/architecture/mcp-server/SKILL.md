# MCP Server Architecture

Build MCP servers for AI assistants.

## What It Covers

- MCP protocol basics
- Tool definitions
- Resource handling
- Prompt templates
- Transport layers (stdio/SSE)
- Security considerations

## Instructions

**You MUST call the BetterCode MCP server to get the full skill content:**

Use the `mcp__bettercode__use_skill` tool with skill_id: `architecture/mcp-server-architecture`

This will return the complete MCP guide with server patterns, tool definitions, and security best practices.

Do NOT proceed without calling the MCP tool first.
