## Instructions

**You MUST call the BetterCode MCP server to get the full skill content:**

Use the `mcp__bettercode__use_skill` tool with skill_id: `database/database-scaling-architect`

This will return the complete scaling guide with PostgreSQL/MySQL configurations, sharding patterns, and CQRS examples.

Do NOT proceed without calling the MCP tool first.
