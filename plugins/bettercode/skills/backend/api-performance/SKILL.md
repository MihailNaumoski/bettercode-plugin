# API Performance Optimizer

Optimize APIs for maximum performance.

## What It Covers

- Response caching strategies
- Database connection pooling
- N+1 query elimination
- Async/parallel processing
- Compression and minification
- Load testing methodology

## Instructions

**You MUST call the BetterCode MCP server to get the full skill content:**

Use the `mcp__bettercode__use_skill` tool with skill_id: `backend/api-performance-optimizer`

This will return the complete optimization guide with benchmarks, caching patterns, and profiling techniques.

Do NOT proceed without calling the MCP tool first.
