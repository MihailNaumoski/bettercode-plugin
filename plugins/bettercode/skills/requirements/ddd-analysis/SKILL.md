# Domain-Driven Design Analysis

Model complex domains with DDD.

## What It Covers

- Bounded context discovery
- Aggregate design
- Context mapping
- Ubiquitous language
- Domain events
- Service boundaries

## Instructions

**You MUST call the BetterCode MCP server to get the full skill content:**

Use the `mcp__bettercode__use_skill` tool with skill_id: `requirements/domain-driven-design-analysis`

This will return the complete DDD guide with event storming techniques and context mapping patterns.

Do NOT proceed without calling the MCP tool first.
