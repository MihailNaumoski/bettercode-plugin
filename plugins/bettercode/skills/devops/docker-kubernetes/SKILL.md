## Instructions

**You MUST call the BetterCode MCP server to get the full skill content:**

Use the `mcp__bettercode__use_skill` tool with skill_id: `devops/docker-kubernetes-expert`

This will return the complete container guide with Dockerfile patterns, K8s manifests, and Helm templates.

Do NOT proceed without calling the MCP tool first.
